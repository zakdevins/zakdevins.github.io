            <h3>The Problem</h3>

            <p>Many of us browse social media to relax at some point in the day. The problem with this is that the “short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops”, as Chamath Palihapitiya, former Vice President of User Growth at Facebook calls them, do anything but relax us. Ten minutes of browsing turns into half an hour, and then an hour—and over the course of the day, perhaps as much as 9 hours (Hayes). Not only does it take up a significant amount of our time, browsing social media makes its users feel worse: Psychology Today magazine highlights a term called relational learning. This is a type of learning which we rely on to gain the most resources by ranking ourselves among others; when we see others with more, we feel negative emotions which drive us to gain more resources (Hayes). Today, we have devices in our pockets which allow us to compare ourselves socially with ease. We are now comparing ourselves to anyone, anywhere, at any time—to billionaires and successful influencers, to lifestyles that we could never live— and it’s no wonder social media makes us feel so anxious.
            <br><br>
            After binging Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit daily for more hours than I want to admit, I was feeling like I’d eaten too much junk food; I felt mentally sluggish, as though my brain was on autopilot. According to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer’s research, scientists know that cognitive stimulation plays a key role in slowing Alzheimer’s progression—and for those who are in early adulthood, regular cognitive challenge could even reduce the risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in their later years. Learning new and challenging things not only feels good, it <i>is good for us</i>.
            <br><br>
            I told myself that I would quit social media—more than a handful of times. I realized that I failed to quit for an extended period of time because not only is social media addictive, but it also is a <b>time filler</b> and a <b>convenient way to mindlessly relax</b>. The great mantra of modernity is “there is no content”—or, as Marshall McLuhan famously put it, “the medium is the message”—and in the case of social media, there is no content since all content is overwhelmed by context. Social media is attention grabbing, and yet has no stimulating content which requires active, deep thinking.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>The Project</h3>

            <p>
            Psychology Today Magazine posed a question in their article “<i>The Unexpected Way New Technology Makes Us Unhappy</i>” which stated: “We're not going backwards. No one is going to smash their iPhones. What we have to do instead is create modern minds for the modern world. The question is: What does that mean and how do we do it?” (Hayes)
            <br><br>
            Laguna is a response to this question. Though Laguna does not aim to be a solution to the ‘social media mental crisis’, it does aim to act as a stepping stone to form healthier habits, and to help create “modern minds for the modern world” by supporting thinking rather than skimming.
            <br><br>
            What I found most difficult about quitting social media was that because I had more free time, I didn’t know how to fill it and I would inevitably return to the platforms I was trying so hard to avoid. When browsing YouTube one day, I came across a channel called Lemmino which creates short 10-20 minute high-quality documentaries on topics like simulated reality, hyperspace, psychological theory, among others. I watched a few videos and, rather than feeling how I usually did after browsing social media, I felt inspired; I wanted to learn more about theories of hyperspace, or whatever I had happened to be watching. I also realized that because I was focusing my attention on one topic for 20 minutes or so, I was thinking more deeply about it and began asking my own questions. In short, a channel such as Lemmino took me out of a state in which I was craving constant and new stimulation, and into one in which I was focused, inspired, and actively thinking.    
            I wanted to create a platform where continuous new learning and something which I call ‘deep browsing’ would be easy. Because social media is accessed both on mobile devices and on the web, I created both a mobile app design as well as a web design. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Design Process and Ideation</h3>

            <p>
            I began with research. I explored any sites which attempted to answer a similar question and analyzed how they did so. I discovered the website Are.na, on which users upload ‘blocks’ (content) into ‘channels’. Users can also link another user’s blocks to their own channel, which creates an interconnected web of content. The content seemed to vary from Tumblr- like photos to complex articles. I liked the idea of Are.na, but I also researched the YouTube channel Lemmino to probe into how the videos capture viewers so well, and what they are doing rhetorically to achieve this. I recognized that Lemmino’s language was casual, conversational, and accessible to all even though the topics of the videos were usually complex. They were also paired with captivating graphics which changed along with the narration. Music also played a large part although I did not implement this aspect into my project. <b>Through my research, I realized that complex topics needed to use accessible language and vivid graphics to be captivating to all users. This, paired with an easy-to-use social-media like platform, would help create a website that would help users think, with ease.</b>
            <br><br>
            I then created sketches to brainstorm how my app and web design would function, and jotted down notes from my research. I knew I wanted Laguna to function like a social media site, as this familiarity and ease of content sharing and viewing would be optimal for a website which means to act as a stepping stone for lessening social media addiction, although this seems ironically. It is not the platforms themselves which are problematic, but rather, their combination with the content they feature. If this content were to be replaced with something more mentally stimulating and satisfying, perhaps it would create a powerful tool which would inspire users to be more ‘mentally conscious’ of the content they consume and promote deeper thought during time spent online.
            <br><br>
             After brainstorming, I created a general layout of what different parts of Laguna would look like. I then created a wireframe of the different pages, and from this created a prototype using Adobe XD which I recorded and made into a video. I conducted five user tests to ensure the wireframe would work smoothly and to determine any problems within the site layout. 
             <br><br> 
            From here, I moved onto the next step which was to create high-fidelity mockups of both the website and app design. I used Adobe Illustrator to create a detailed visualization of the site and app layout. I wanted the site to feel ‘clean’ and sleek, so I focused on minimal design (even with the logo) that would focus on the content and invoke a similar feeling of viewing artwork in a gallery. This would optimally compel the user to reflect on what they are viewing or reading without the distraction of a more complex, ‘claustrophobic’ site such as Facebook, which is full of different areas which capture the user’s attention. I decided to use a flat design to further promote the minimalist aesthetic I had in mind.

            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/digital/thumbnails/10.png" alt="">
            <br><br>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/digital/thumbnails/3.gif" alt="">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h3>Final Designs</h3>

            <p>
            I created a detailed layout of how the site would function. Firstly, the user would be directed to scrolling down the homepage. This page includes a brief ‘about’ section which highlights Laguna’s vision and purpose in a conversational tone, followed by a ‘how it works’ section which details a brief explanation of how the site functions. This was something that frustrated me after exploring Are.na, since I had to find out how the different features worked on my own. This section would be followed by one which would list a few chosen user reviews. Finally, the last section is meant to give users a taste of what kind of content they might find on Laguna. These would be featured articles, and the user could click on one of them to read the whole article.
            <br><br>
            From here, the user could either click on the ‘discover’ button at the top left-hand corner, or the ‘see more’ button at the bottom which would lead to the ‘discover’ page. The ‘login’ button at the top right would prompt the user to either make an account or log in to their existing account.
            <br><br>
            The ‘discover’ page functions similarly to a social media feed, as it shows content or articles scattered abut the white space. They are not cropped or fit to one size as Instagram posts are, but each can have different sizes (although they would be restricted to a maximum size). This would reinforce the art-gallery-like effect. The user has the option to search for particular topics or key words using the ‘search’ tab. They are also able to sort through the content that they see with the ‘sort by’ button, which would feature options such as ‘sort by following’, ‘sort by new’, ‘sort by featured’, and ‘sort by popular’. The user can also search for articles by their different tags. Each article or post which is posted would prompt the publisher to create a minimum of three topic tags. These tags make it easier to find related posts if a user is looking for a specific topic that may not be evident in the title.
            <br><br>
            From here, the user can click on their avatar image at the top right-hand corner (if they are logged in) to view their profile page. The page is split into two sections: ‘saved’ and ‘created’. The user can search through either of these sections using tags or keywords to make it easier to find a particular post. I noticed that it was impossible to find ‘blocks’ on Are.na unless you manually searched for them through their associated channel. I wanted to implement a more user-friendly feature, so I created the addition of a search bar within the user’s saved posts so that saved posts are easier to find, even if they are unorganized. The user also has the option to organize their saved and created files by creating ‘folders’ for them. On each page, the user has the option to click on the ‘Laguna’ homepage button (which is the logo), the ‘discover’ button which leads to the ‘discover’ page, or the login/ logout button.
            <br><br>
            A less noticeable though still important area of the site is the bottom ‘contact’ section, which would feature links to the official Laguna Twitter/Instagram/Gmail. Such accounts would be put into place not only for users to be able to contact Laguna for inquiries, but also to gain more users. The Laguna site could be promoted through these accounts, since the majority of the targeted audience are those who browse social media (but are dissatisfied with it, which makes up a large percentage). While potential users browse their social media feeds, they could see a promoted post which features the Laguna site and app. Advertisements and promoted posts are becoming more and more popular on Instagram in particular. The Twitter account could be used to share featured or popular posts, rather than promoting the site itself. This would attract the attention of potential users better than the promotion of the site or app itself. Advertisements on Twitter do not seem to do well, unless they are discreet.
            <br><br>
            The Laguna site and app is mainly targeted at 16-35 year-olds who browse social media, but are dissatisfied at it. It is also more generally targeted at anyone who wants to learn about new and complex topics in an easy to understand fun way.
            <br><br>
            The look of Laguna is minimalistic and simple, yet elegant. The aesthetic of the site is meant to promote a feeling similar to that of viewing art in an art gallery, which means that the design and layout would need to be simple and draw attention to the content rather than the site itself. The idea of the name of the site, as well as the logo, came from something I had discovered while writing an essay. Lacuna is Latin for "a gap, void, want," but also "pond or lake” (Etymonline).

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

            <p>
            One of the most important things I learned through completing this project is that an idea is really just the beginning of things. Implementing an idea into the real world requires not only planning and research, but also a lot of consideration of the user’s desires. Throughout each phase of ideation and planning, I needed to ask myself: is this what the user would want? What would make their experience with the site easier and more enjoyable? What would the user be looking for aesthetically in a site like this?
            <br><br>
            This was my first large UX project, and I learned that the most important consideration was the user and their desires. I also learned how to visually implement the ‘mission statement’ throughout my design choices while creating the site and app. For example, I purposefully avoided showing the number of saves that a post would have to users, and yet the back-end would keep track of the total saves on each post so that popular posts would show up when users would sort their feed by ‘most popular’. This would avoid the problem that I came across when using Instagram. I realized that I was far more ready to ‘like’ a post when it had a lot of likes, versus a post which had much fewer, merely because of its popularity. I learned to observe and take note of my own experiences and implement features that would promote better experiences for users.
            <br><br>
            I am continuing to develop Laguna. Currently, I am taking steps to make the site go live.

            <p>New Exodus is a concept design for an open world video game, complete with a detailed strategy guide which walks through the storyline. The game takes place in a future, post-war setting where Artificial Intelligence is the new dominant species, and the landscape is just beginning to recover from decades of man-made destruction. I have created digital concept art for this project through Photoshop and Illustrator, after multiple sketches and drafts.
